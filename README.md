We have designed a series of sound effects that can be used to make non-verbal behavior in VR accessible to people who are blind and low vision. These sound effects provide auditory cues and feedback to enhance the immersive experience and enable individuals with visual impairments to engage with virtual reality environments. By incorporating these sound effects, social VR platforms can create a more inclusive and engaging experience for all users, regardless of their visual abilities.

## Usage
